# UI/UX Rules

- Keep sticky headers for app tabs and logs for constant visibility.
- Chat input bar should be sticky at the bottom; Stop button must be a native `<button type="button">` and call `agent.cancelRun`.
- File operation results should render action buttons (Open/Show) and never default to writing files unless explicitly requested.
- Add model selector UI and persist selected model; default to LM Studio.
- Keep components themeâ€‘consistent with muted purple gradient.
